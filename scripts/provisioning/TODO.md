# TODO

- use a shared bash.env file for both config/bash and scripts/provisioning/bash
    - that bash.env should be the idea setup which compatible with my current usage scenarios
    - need duplicate naming for the ease of installation as well as add to path
- installation\_prefix can be deprecated in favour of this
